# Simple SDL project
I am still learning SDL and this project simply showcases the much I've learnt.

In it, your helicopter simply follows your mouse around and if it collides with the green helicopter, the game ends.
That's all

## Building and running
1. Make sure you have all the necessary SDL libraries (SDL2, SDL2-ttf, SDL2-net, SDL2-image, SDL2-mixer). I barely use all of them but just included them because I don't know which content falls where.
2. Navigate to the project directory and run `make` (Make should also be installed). This will build the project and create an `output.exe` file in the `bin` folder.
3. You can choose to either run `make run` or `bin/output.exe` in the same shell environment. Both instances give you the same output.
4. Don't forget to clean up by running `make clean`.
5. And that's all. I pray it works fine for you. Good luck.

### PostScript
Just so you know. I'm still a *beginner* and open to anything you can suggest.

#### Thank you
